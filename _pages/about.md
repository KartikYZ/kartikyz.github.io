##### About
Hi! I'm currently in my final year of the BS Computer Science program at <b><strong>Georgia Institute of Technology</strong></b>. My degree specializations are Machine Learning and Systems. 

##### Research
My current research centers around LLM-serving of mixture-of-expert models and efficient training of GNN-LLM hybrid architectures. I'm currently advised by <a href="https://www.anand-iyer.com/">Dr. Anand Iyer</a> and mentored by <a href="https://mingyuguan.github.io/">Mingyu Guan</a>

Prior to this I was a research assistant at the Embedded Pervasive Lab in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech. My research centers around scheduling DAG workloads in edge environments and FaaS systems for latency-sensitive/critical applications. I was advised by <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~rama/">Dr. Ramachandran</a> and mentored by <a href="http://jinsunyoo.com/">Jinsun Yoo</a>.

##### Work
I have interned as a software engineer at Citadel, AWS Cryptography, and Amazon Finance. 

At Citadel, I built an automation platform for booking transactions crediting trading desks to enhance operations efficiency, now in production use. 

In AWS, I worked to enhance credentials distribution flows of a large-scale distributed secrets management internal service. 

In Amazon Finance, I worked to design and prototype an internal tool for multi-user, real-time financial report generation. 

I also serve as a Teaching Assistant for CS 3510, Design and Analysis of Algorithms at Georgia Tech. Prior to this, I was a TA for CS 2110, Computer Organization and Programming.

##### Interests
I'm interested in ML research and distributed systems. In my spare time, I like to build things using code, read topics in math, and learn about ML systems.

I also play the piano (Trinity College London, Music, Grade 7) and enjoy listening to classical, neoclassical and electronic music.
